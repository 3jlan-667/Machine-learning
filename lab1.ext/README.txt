I created a GitHub account by entering my email address and setting a strong password. After that, I explored the platform and learned about its main features.
I created a repository named Machine Learning and sub-repositories to organize and store files related to ML labs. I also explored different features such as uploading and downloading files, editing files directly on GitHub and managing repositories.
